      <h1>Hey Sean, I think we can do better.</h1>
      <p>Yeah, I’m talking about that Mass Text Assignment. I’m not going to print it. I’m not going to produce another piece of useless waste. Let’s make it clear – I spent a lot of time polishing it and while the idea of seeing it in your book shelf will make me happy, I think we can spend our money and resources better.</p>

      <h2>But mainly, we should do something for our planet too, don’t you think?</h2>
      <p>So while you will be checking my stuff here: <br><a href="MASS-TEXT-2-SPREADS.pdf">Legibility Rules</a>, <a href="MASS-TEXT-1-SPREADS.pdf">Legibility and Readability Layouts</a></p>

      <h2>I’m going to donate $50 to Chimp Haven in Keithville, LA. </h2>
      <p><a href="#">Chimp Haven</a>, The National Chimpanzee Sanctuary, is an independent nonprofit organization located on 200 acres in Northwest Louisiana and is currently home to more than 200 residents. The majority of our chimps were retired from biomedical research, but are now experiencing the freedoms of retirement. At Chimp Haven they can simply be chimps; living in large social groups and choosing how they will spend their day. </p>

      <h2>Thank you. </h2>
